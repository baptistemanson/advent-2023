# Learnings

## Important

- I can still code in Rust
- I understand more compiler errors because I understand Rust better
- updating Rust
- Better with lifetimes, Slice, String, Vector, module system, refs, box
- Parse stuff is somewhat easy
- array map + fold + chunk + split_once + split
- custom iterators
- stack vs heap
- closures
- drain and mem::swp to reduce allocations
- flamegraph analysis for optimizations

## Less important

- brushed up on error management
- const str instead of file
- nth and iterator
- u8 for chars
- bitset
- could use test to run the programs each day instead of maintaining a main file?
